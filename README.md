# Probability-Distribution-Random-Variable-Generator

This program generates N amount of random variables for continuous uniform, exponential, Bernoulli, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma, and discrete distribution with the support set {1,2,3,4} and pmf 
P[W_i=j]= (j+1)/10, j=1,2,3, i=1,2,...N. 

Upon starting the program, the user is allowed to select which distribution they would like to generate random variables for, as well as specify the number of variables (N) and distribution parameters. 

Then the program will generate N random variables of the selected probability distribution for the specificed parameters.
